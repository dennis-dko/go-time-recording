# What the audits have left open

The audits' leftovers that have to outlive them: decisions put to the
maintainer - the code is right and the taste is arguable, a fix that buys
little, or one of the critical decisions `CLAUDE.md` names - and measurements
that reading cannot make. They used to live in `AUDIT_REPORT.md`, a git-ignored
scratchpad that is now started fresh for every audit, so they live here.

An item is added in the commit of the read that raises it, and removed in the
commit that settles it, with the decision in that commit's message.

Carried over on 2026-10-09 from the report of the audits since late September.
Left out as settled by then: D-new-9 (a restart and a cold start give one answer
since the restart hands on the environment the process started with), D-new-26
(the installer's prefill behind the token, #284), D6 (MySQL refuses to start in
another zone, #317), D1 and D2 (no such comments and no such splits remain).
What is below was raised and is not recorded as decided anywhere.

## Decisions waiting on the maintainer

| | Question |
| --- | --- |
| D-new-37 | The recover() in `spreadsheet.rowsOf` has no known panic left to catch: go.mod requires the upstream excelize commit that fixes GHSA-wcg2-648h-mhxq and the fifteen advisories of 2026-10-09. Keep it for the next one, given that record, or remove it as the test that watched it intended - a recover() with no reason left? Either way, go.mod moves from the pseudo-version to the first release that carries the fixes. |

## Measurements reading cannot make

Each needs real infrastructure, and none is a change to make on a guess.

- Whether an account can come to depend on a directory entry behind a referral.
  A run collects referrals and does not follow them; `task test:ldap` runs
  OpenLDAP, and this needs a real Active Directory.
- Whether a desktop browser's history keeps the `/?token=` address the
  installer's page was opened with. The page takes it out of the address bar at
  once; headless Chrome records no history, so this needs a real browser.
- The wall time of a first directory run over thousands of accounts on SQLite,
  and on the Pi: one commit per arrival.
